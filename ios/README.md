## The submodule weex-playground

[Weex Playground](https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex-playground/tree/master/ios) can be used to test and preview weex pages on iOS and it has been added as a submodule.

### Relationship between weex and playground

- The playground submodule will be cloned and updated automatically when developers clone the ‘incubator-weex’ repo and build it. In this case, playground project will use the current incubator-weex project as it's pod source.

- When developer directly clone the 'weex-playground' repo and run it separately, the playground project will use the lastest incubator-weex project in master branch as it's pod source.
