    PrimaryPass,
    
    // At this point we know what is numerical and what isn't. Non-numerical inputs

    // use Baseline rare case profiles for purely numerical operations and it will
    // ignore them for everything else. The point of this pass is to develop a good
    // guess of which variables are likely to be doubles.
    //
    // This pass is intentionally weird and goes against what is considered good
    // form when writing a static analysis: a new data flow of booleans will cause
    // us to ignore rare case profiles except that by then, we will have already
    // propagated double types based on our prior assumption that we shouldn't
    // ignore rare cases. This probably won't happen because the PrimaryPass is
    // almost certainly going to establish what is and isn't numerical. But it's
    // conceivable that during this pass we will discover a new boolean data flow.
    // This ends up being sound because the prediction propagator could literally
    // make any guesses it wants and still be sound (worst case, we OSR exit more
    // often or use too general of types are run a bit slower). This will converge
    // because we force monotonicity on the types of nodes and variables. So, the
    // worst thing that can happen is that we violate basic laws of theoretical
    // decency.
    RareCasePass,
    
    // At this point we know what is numerical and what isn't, and we also know what
    // is a double and what isn't. So, we start forcing variables to be double.

    // in the sense that once a variable is forced double, it cannot be forced in
    // the other direction.

    // implicit. Liveness is only explicit at block heads (variablesAtHead).
    // This is only used by the DFG simplifier and is only preserved by same.
    //
    // For example, LoadStore form gives no easy way to determine which SetLocal's
    // flow into a GetLocal. As well, LoadStore form implies no restrictions on
    // redundancy: you can freely emit multiple GetLocals, or multiple SetLocals
    // (or any combination thereof) to the same local in the same block. LoadStore
    // form does not require basic blocks to declare how they affect or use locals,
    // other than implicitly by using the local ops and by preserving
    // variablesAtHead. Finally, LoadStore allows flexibility in how liveness of
    // locals is extended; for example you can replace a GetLocal with a Phantom
    // and so long as the Phantom retains the GetLocal's children (i.e. the Phi
    // most likely) then it implies that the local is still live but that it need
    // not be stored to the stack necessarily. This implies that Phantom can
    // reference nodes that have no result, as long as those nodes are valid
    // GetLocal children (i.e. Phi, SetLocal, SetArgument).
    //
    // LoadStore form also implies that Phis need not have children. By default,
    // they end up having no children if you enter LoadStore using the canonical
    // way (call Graph::dethread).
    //
    // LoadStore form is suitable for CFG transformations, as well as strength
    // reduction, folding, and CSE.
    LoadStore,
    
    // ThreadedCPS form means that basic blocks list up-front which locals they
    // expect to be live at the head, and which locals they make available at the
    // tail. ThreadedCPS form also implies that:
    //
    // - GetLocals and SetLocals are not redundant within a basic block.
    //
    // - All GetLocals and Flushes are linked directly to the last access point
    //   of the variable, which must not be another GetLocal.
    //
    // - Phantom(Phi) is not legal, but PhantomLocal is.
    //
    // ThreadedCPS form is suitable for data flow analysis (CFA, prediction
    // propagation), register allocation, and code generation.
