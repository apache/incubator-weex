    BadIdent, // We exited because we made an incorrect assumption about what identifier we would see. Usually used for cached Id check in get_by_val.
    BadExecutable, // We exited because we made an incorrect assumption about what executable we would see.
    BadCache, // We exited because an inline cache was wrong.
    BadConstantCache, // We exited because a cache on a weak constant (usually a prototype) was wrong.
    BadIndexingType, // We exited because an indexing type was wrong.
    BadTypeInfoFlags, // We exited because we made an incorrect assumption about what TypeInfo flags we would see.
    Overflow, // We exited because of overflow.
    NegativeZero, // We exited because we encountered negative zero.
    Int52Overflow, // We exited because of an Int52 overflow.

    LoadFromHole, // We had a load from a hole.
    OutOfBounds, // We had an out-of-bounds access to an array.
    InadequateCoverage, // We exited because we ended up in code that didn't have profiling coverage.
    ArgumentsEscaped, // We exited because arguments escaped but we didn't expect them to.
    ExoticObjectMode, // We exited because some exotic object that we were accessing was in an exotic mode (like Arguments with slow arguments).
    NotStringObject, // We exited because we shouldn't have attempted to optimize string object access.
    VarargsOverflow, // We exited because a varargs call passed more arguments than we expected.
    TDZFailure, // We exited because we were in the TDZ and accessed the variable.
    HoistingFailed, // Something that was hoisted exited. So, assume that hoisting is a bad idea.
    Uncountable, // We exited for none of the above reasons, and we should not count it. Most uses of this should be viewed as a FIXME.
    UncountableInvalidation, // We exited because the code block was invalidated; this means that we've already counted the reasons why the code block was invalidated.
    WatchdogTimerFired, // We exited because we need to service the watchdog timer.
    DebuggerEvent, // We exited because we need to service the debugger.
    ExceptionCheck, // We exited because a direct exception check showed that we threw an exception from a C call.
    GenericUnwind, // We exited because a we arrived at this OSR exit from genericUnwind.
