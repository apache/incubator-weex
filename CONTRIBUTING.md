## Code Style Guide

### Objective-C

* Tabs for indentation(not spaces)
* `*` operator goes with the variable name (e.g. Type *variable;)
* Function definitions: place each brace on its own line.
* Other braces: place the open brace on the line preceding the code block; place the close brace on its own line.
* Use `#pragma marks` to categorize methods into functional groupings and protocol implementations
* Follow other guidelines on [GitHub Objective-C Style Guide](https://github.com/github/objective-c-style-guide)

### Java & Android 

* Use [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) as basic guidelines of java code.
* Follow [AOSP Code Style](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html) for rest of android related code style.
