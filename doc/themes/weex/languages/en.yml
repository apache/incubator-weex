  feature:
    title: Help you build a real Native App
    content: Different from a "web app", "HTML5 app", or "hybrid app", you can use Weex to build a real mobile app. The code that you write is relatively simple, because you can build native applications just using HTML, CSS, Javascript. But underneath, the core of the application is Objective-C or Java. At the same time, Weex will provide a lot of native components or modules for developers to use.
  cross_platform:
    title: Write Once Run Everywhere
    content: Weex provides the ability to publish cross platform, so web, Android, and IOS apps can use the same API development functions. At the same time, we provide a rich extension of the native interfaces. In this way, it will be very convenient when you need to extend native components or modules.
  vue:
    title: Supporting Vue syntax
    content: Weex follows the web standard, while supporting the "vue.js" syntax. So, you can use the "vue.js" syntax to develop applications.
  schematic:
    title: How it works
    content: Weex is a extendable cross-platform solution for dynamic programming and publishing projects. In the source code you can write pages or components with <template>, <style> and <script> tags, and then transform them into bundles for deploying. On the server-side we can use these JS bundles for client requests. When clients get a bundle from the server, it will be processed by the client-side JavaScript engine that manages the native view rendering, the native API invoking, and user interactions.
