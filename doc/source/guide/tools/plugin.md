{
    "tag": "loading", //tag name, not null
    "attrs": [ //attributes of tag, can be null
      {
        "name": "display", //attribute name, not null
        "valuePattern": null, //pattern expression to check the attribute value, can be null
        "valueEnum": [ //attribute value enumeration, can be null
          "show",
          "hide"
        ],
        "valueType": "var", //type of attribute value, must be var or function
        "since": 0, //which version the attribute is added to sdk, such as 0.11
        "weexOnly": false //whether the attribute is available only in 1.0 syntax, default is false
      }
    ],
    "events": [ //events list, can be null
      {
        "name": "loading", //event name, not null
        "since": 0 //which version the event is added to sdk
      }
    ],
    "parents": [ //The tag is allowed to be a child of which tags, null means no restrictions
      "list",
      "scroller"
    ],
    "childes": [ //which tags are allowed as their own child tags, null means no restrictions
      "text",
      "image",
      "loading-indicator"
    ],
