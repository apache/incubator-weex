# Get Started

Weex is a framework for building Mobile cross-platform high performance UI. Developers can write `*.vue` files to build native pages or an App. This page will help you write a Weex page in 2 minutes.

## What is Vue?

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is an excellent progressive JavaScript framework written by [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi). Now Weex and Vue has supported each other officially. Weex put Vue 2.x as its built-in JS Framework, and Vue has already been able to develop native mobile app.

## Hello world

The easiest way to try Weex is to use the [Playground App](../playground.html) and write a Hello World example at [dotWe](https://dotwe.org). You don't need to consider installing the development environment or writing native code, just do the following two things:

- Install the [Playground App](../playground.html) for your phone.
- Open [the Hello World example](http://dotwe.org/vue/4d5a0471ece3daabd4681bc6d703c4c1) in a new tab, click run, and then use the Playground App to scan the QR code.

Nailed it! In this case, We can see HTML semantic tags, CSS styles and Javascript code. This is one of the simplest Weex examples. It rendered a "Hello World" in the page. Please note that this is not a Web page.

### What happened?

As shown in the following code：

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <text class="text">{{text}}</text>
  </div>
</template>

<style>
  .text {
    font-size: 50;
  }
</style>

<script>
  export default {
    data () {
      return {
        text: 'Hello World.'
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

It's too easy，right? Let's focus on the syntax, obviously this is vue.

You can try to modify the Hello World, then generate a new QR code to scan.

## Set up development environment 

Use dotWe is a good choice, But if you want to develop locally on your own machine, you will set up your development environment.

You will need Node.js and the Weex CLi.

You can installing Node using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (Simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing nvm:

```bash
$ nvm install 6.10.0
$ nvm use 6.10.0
```

Node.js comes with npm, which lets you install the Weex Cli.

Run the following command in a Terminal:

```bash
$ npm install -g weex-toolkit@beta
```

**NOTE: ** If you get an error like "permission error",  try installing with `sudo`.


Then you can use the weex command to verify that the installation is successful:

### Generate a new Weex project

You can use CLi to generate a Weex project called "awesome-project". Run the following command in a Terminal:

```bash
$ weex init awesome-project
```

Then we enter the awesome-project folder, the CLi has been for us to generate a standard project structure.

### Usage

We enter the awesome-project folder and install dependencies with the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

Then we run `npm run dev` and `npm run serve` to start watch mode and static server.

Finally, we can see the Weex page in `http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

If you're curious to learn more about technical details, continue on to the next. And don't forget to write code at [dotWe](https://dotwe.org) and preview at anytime.
