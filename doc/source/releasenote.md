[apache/incubator-weex/pull/104|https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/pull/104]

## v0.10.0
------
- New Feature
  - Support Vue.js  
    The Vue.js 2.1.8 ([runtime-only build](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Standalone-vs-Runtime-only-Build)) is in WeexSDK now. You can use Vue.js to build native app by WeexSDK 0.10.0.  
    We reused the original native render engine and developed a new renderer ([weex-vue-render](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weex-vue-render)) for the web platform, which is based on Vue 2.0.  
    The former front-end framework (commonly known as `.we`), which is inspired by Vue 1.0, is deprecated. Although it still works well in this release, we suggest to migrate it to Vue 2.0.
  - SDK
    - New CSS support
      - [text `font-weight`](https://weex-project.io/references/text-style.html)  
        `font-weight` can set to [`normal`|`bold`] or 100-900.
      - gradient  
        like CSS3, now you can use gradient in Weex. For example:   
        
        ``` css
        background-image: linear-gradient(to right, blue, white);
        ```
        ![img_1695](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/115201/23015955/ba075876-f46f-11e6-9d88-2ca3096551b9.jpeg)
        [Read more about gradient](https://weex-project.io/references/common-style.html).
      - Pseudo class  
        Currently, Weex supports 4 pseudo classes:`active`, `focus`, `disabled`, `enabled`. 
    - New BroadcastChannel API
      Developers can use `BroadcastChannel` API to implement inter-instance communication.   
      
      ``` js
      const Stack = new BroadcastChannel('Avengers')
      Stack.onmessage = function (event) {
        console.log(event.data) // in this case, it's "Hulk Smash !!!"
      }
      
      // in another instance
      const Hulk = new BroadcastChannel('Avengers')
      Hulk.postMessage("Hulk Smash !!!")
      ```
    - Image's `onload` event add [`naturalHeight` and `naturalWidthimage`](https://weex-project.io/references/components/image.html) to get the original size of image file.
    - Websocket Support  
      WebSockets is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication session between the user's h5/iOS/android and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.  
      [Read more about Weex's websocket.](https://weex-project.io/cn/references/modules/websocket.html)
    - Support synchronous method call
      Both module and component method can defined synchronous method exposed to JS runtime now. Means native will invoke these method in JS thread directly.
    - Support `viewport` configuration
      Similar to [W3C specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-device-adapt/#viewport-meta), Weex support set define `viewport` in script tag:   
      
      ``` html
      <script type="config">
        {
          "viewport": {
              "width": "device-width"
          }
        }
      </script>
      ```
  - Tools   
    - [Devtools](https://github.com/weexteam/weex-devtool)
      - Support Vue 2.0 debugging.  
      - Add network switch for network inspector.
      - Make application capable to decide which bundle is 'un-debuggable', which means page's source code is unreadable in debug mode.
    - [Weexpack](https://github.com/weexteam/weex-pack)
      - Has full set of commands for developers to setup android/ios application with his .we/.vue files.
      - Developers could easily pack/install his application with simple command.
      - Has full set of commands for developers to manage weex plugins, including create plugin template, add plugin to his project etc.
      - [Plugin market](http://market.weex-project.io) was formally used for developers to publish/download weex plugins.


## v0.9.4
------
- New features
  - SDK
    - New API to get Component's size and position:
      Now you can get these data through `getComponentRect`:   
      ``` javascript
      var dom = require('@weex-module/dom');
      dom.getComponentRect(this.$el('comp_id'), function(data){
        if(data.result)
          console.log(data);
      });
      ```
      The `data` callback parameter contains a `result` to tell if operation is success. And `size` tell you the true data(`bottom`/`top`/`left`/`right`/`width`/`height`) of component.
    - A brand new `picker` module. We have 'single-picker','date-picker' and 'time-picker' currently, and more common pickers are on the way.  
      ![img_1282](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/115201/21414801/e6341b36-c83d-11e6-9e5a-3acdabb592ee.png)
    There are two ways to use `picker`
    - Use `picker` module directly:
    ``` javascript
    var picker = require('@weex-module/picker');
    var self = this;
    picker.pickDate({
        'value':'2016-11-28',
        'max':'2029-11-28',
        'min':'2015-11-28'
    },function (ret) {
        var result = ret.result;
        if(result == 'success')
        {
            self.value = ret.data;
        }
    });
    ```
    - `input` component also add 'date' and 'time`type to work with`picker` module internally:
    ``` html
    <input
      type="date"
      placeholder="select date"
      class="input"
      autofocus="false"
      value=""
      onchange="onchange"
      max = "2029-11-28"
      min = "2015-11-28"
              ></input>
    ```
  - Support animation with `width` and `height` property.
  - Support use empty value to reset css property to default value.
  - Components can expose methods too, like modules do. Developers use the same way as create module method to achieve that.
  -  Add `blur` and `focus` method to manually control `input` component to lose or get focus.
  -  Support relative URL, which will resolve real URL by bundle's URL.
  -  Core javascript framework's unit test coverage is 100% now. we'll pay more attention to quality.
